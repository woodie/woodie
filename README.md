I've been developing Rails apps
[since 2006](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woodie/),
and I even built a simple Rails clone called
[Dubious](https://github.com/mirah/dubious) in
[Mirah](https://github.com/mirah/mirah) that I
[presented at JRubyKaigi2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keTHt3wf4HU)
in Tsukuba, Japan. This was useful for scaling Rails apps on Google App Engine for Java.

Sometimes, I just like to carry a smart feature phone. I created Caltrain apps for
[KaiOS](https://github.com/woodie/next-caltrain-pwa) and
[J2ME](https://github.com/woodie/Caltrain-Schedule-MIDlet).
The KaiOS version is a
[PWA](http://next-caltrain-pwa.appspot.com/)
written with VanillaJS.

Additionally, I like to implement algorithms
[in several languages](https://github.com/woodie/coding_challenges)
to refresh my memory on syntax and features.
I've also created some obscure Docker images like
[nanoserver-ruby](https://github.com/woodie/nanoserver-ruby) and
[geminabox](https://github.com/woodie/geminabox-ldap).
