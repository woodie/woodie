I've been developing Rails apps
[since 2006](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woodie/),
and I even built a simple Rails clone called
[Dubious](https://github.com/mirah/dubious) in
[Mirah](https://github.com/mirah/mirah) that I
[presented at JRubyKaigi2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keTHt3wf4HU)
in Tsukuba, Japan. This was useful for scaling Rails apps on Google App Engine for Java.

I also like feature phones and I sometimes **commute on Caltrain**.
It's important to know when trains will depart so I created
a Caltrain schedule app. Actually I created two apps: one for
[KaiOS](https://github.com/woodie/next-caltrain-pwa) and another for
[J2ME](https://github.com/woodie/Caltrain-Schedule-MIDlet).
The KaiOS version is a
[PWA](http://next-caltrain-pwa.appspot.com/)
written with VanillaJS and was a lot of fun to create.
Although J2ME has no future, I published a J2ME
[Soduku app](https://github.com/woodie/Sudoku-J2ME)
and mocked up a J2ME
[Tesla app](https://github.com/woodie/Tesla-J2ME) for fun.

Additionally, I try to implement algorithms
[in several languages](https://github.com/woodie/coding_challenges)
to refresh my memory on the language syntax.
I've also created some obscure Docker images, like
[nanoserver-ruby](https://github.com/woodie/nanoserver-ruby), or
[geminabox](https://github.com/woodie/geminabox-ldap) (that runs on Docker
and authenticates users against LDAP or ActiveDirectory).
